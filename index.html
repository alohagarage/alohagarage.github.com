    <h1>What is Your Apollo?</h1>
    <h3>The End of the End?</h3>
    <p>In a recent article for the MIT Technology Review, Editor in Chief Jason Pontin 
    offers a good summary and explanation of the current state of the art of defeatism. He points 
    to the now-commonplace plaint among venture capitalist about the paucity of big ideas: best summed up 
    in my opinion, by Mike Arrington who decried the new explosion of "dipshit companies" (it's a social-local-mobile app for 
    vegan mountain bikers!). Peter Thiel claims that all Twitter has given the world 
    is job security for 500 people into the next decade. Whatever flavor of bitching you choose, it is 
    obvious that the tide is against Solving Big Problems.</p>

    <p>But before we complain too much, we should stop and give ourselves a pat on the back. 
    The world and the lives of the humans on it is better now than it has ever been by almost any metric you 
    choose.</p>

    <h3>The End of Technological Problems</h3>
    <h3>Fear of Humanity</h3>
    <p>I have a hypothesis; all the more strident for the fact that it's 
    unfalsifiable. My hypothesis is that WWII left most of the Western World 
    frightened of the human will, particularly as it manifests itself 
    <em> en masse</em> as the political will. We should not forget the extent 
    to which the middle of this century was truly a triumph of the will. Take 
    the (for some reason) less controversial example of Japan. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Japan was feudal until around 1868, at which point, we opened Japan by force. 
    By 1931, the had invaded China a country heavily supported by the most powerful industrial powers in the 
    world. To put this in perspective, the last vestiges of Feudalism in Western Europe were in the 15th 
    century. Which means that, within 42 years, Japan was able to industrialize enough to 
    threaten the West. This was not done through the "normal" course of technological 
    evolution, but rather through an almost incomprehensible force of political 
    will. 
    </p>
    <p>
    It is important to realize that the Axis powers (and Russia) truly shared 
    this idea: That "natural" technological and economic advancement would doom
    their nations to always be the servants of countries that either had a head 
    start or had natural geo-political advantages. They were underdeveloped and backward. 
    They knew that if they were to let things ride, they would have been eaten alive.
    So they embraced a multitude of political ideologies that placed the will 
    above technology, above the economy; of these, Italian Fascism was the 
    most pure, since it did not need an admixture of Blood and Soil rascism to 
    make it go.
    </p>
    <p>
    And when we, the West, came face to face with this and the risks associated 
    it, we flinched. Instead of trying to harness the possibilities of the political 
    will, increasingly necessary in an age when technology and the market threaten 
    to spin out of control, we simply ignored it. And we did what all cultures 
    convinced of their own progress do: we made a virtue of a necessity. We decided 
    that this awful power which we had shirked was actually <strong>bad</strong> 
    and we were <strong>good</strong> by virtue of not having it. We began to 
    treat our political impotence as itself a sign of our moral superiority
    </p>
    <p>
    More amazing than this gambit which, given the atrocities of WWII, are somewhat 
    understandable, is how long it has worked. I believe that this is because:
    <ol>
      <li>Our economy was already crapping on everybody.</li>
      <li>The rest of the world was far more affected by WWII.</li>
      <li>Our country is geographically superior to most major powers.</li>
    </ol>
    And here is maybe my most controversial claim: technological problems are 
    hard on a personal level, but easy on a societal level. Given enough money 
    enough time and politians with a modicum of sense, these problems will be 
    solved. The people who work hard on them every day should be proud, but 
    society taking credit for it is like taking credit for because you didn't 
    chop them down. Technological problems also allow us to skirt (if we want 
    to) truly <em>human</em> problems like What is justice, What is the right 
    way to live, What is love. The "Scientific" answers to these questions (which 
    are abundant) are farcical and patently unsatisfying to anyone who is not getting 
    paid to provide them. The fear of the human forced us to flee into the other 
    extremes; into the depths of space and the sea, into the mysteries of the atom 
    and beyond. But unfortunately, we've gotten to the point of answering 
    questions whose motivation we've forgotten. Why should we want to live forever?
    Why should we want to expore new stars? Why should we even try to assure a 
    dignified life for people we've never met? Instead of truly answering these 
    questions, we've plastered them over with platitudes, once again moving the 
    goalposts so that we can paint our failings as "enlightenment", as proof of our 
    "tolerance". Anyone who doesn't see the intellectual cowardice of this is fooling 
    themselves.
